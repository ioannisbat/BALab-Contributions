   We are always looking for brilliant people to join our growing group.
 New ISTLab members can join as researchers, PhD candidates, research associates, or research assistants.</br>
 ISTLab <b>researchers</b> are typically academic members of the Athens University of Economics and Business or post-doctoral researchers
 working within the Lab.
 </br>
 </br>
     <b>PhD candidates</b> joining the lab must be enrolled and active in an academic PhD programme. Twice a year the Department of Management
 Science and Technology of the Athens University of Economics and Business issues a call for new PhD candidates.
 PhD candidates have a graduate and postgraduate degree in Computer Science, Information Systems, or equivalent qualifications.
 They have the opportunity to manage and work on a number of cutting edge research initiatives.
 </br></br>
     <b>Research associates</b> have a degree (or are in their final year of study) in Computer Science, Information Systems, or an equivalent
 programme. They can participate in our research activities with a chance to influence the future of Information Systems Technology.
     </br></br>
 We have also a limited number of open positions for research assistants: exceptional undergraduate students who wish to gain
 meaningful research experience or external affiliates providing consulting or administrative support to the Lab's activities.

 <h3><b>Collaboration opportunities</b></h3>
 <p>We are always interested in establishing collaboration links with leading industrial and academic partners.
 Becoming an ISTLab collaborator provides you a valuable link with one of the most dynamic research groups in our area.
 Benefits include research collaboration opportunities, the participation in organised events, advance information on new activities,
 a listing of your organisation's name and logo in our site's web page, and periodic research intelligence updates.<br>
